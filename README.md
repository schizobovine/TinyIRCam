# TinyIRCam
Simple mash up of a [TinyScreen+](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/all/products/tinyscreenplus) and a 8x8 [GridEye IR sensor breakout](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/grid-eye-8-x-8-ir-array/>).

## Building
You will need the [TinyScreen+ board definition installed](https://tinycircuits.com/blogs/learn/158833543-tinyscreen-setup) in a working Arduino 1.6+ environment to build the code.
